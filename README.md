# Professor Evaluation Report: COGS 108 Group Project



### Introduction:

CAPE at University of Califronia, San Diego is an anonymous online rating sytem for students to provide feedback to the instrutors and their courses. In this data analysis study, we try to look at the correlation between course difficulty and instructor ratings on CAPE, and whether this correlation is significantly different among courses in different fields of study (STEM, Social Science, and Humanities).

### Libraries Used: 

* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* re
* patsy
* statsmodels

### What I did: 
* Data cleaning (pandas, numpy, re) 
* Data analysis (seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels)
* Video Production (Davinci Resolve, Google Slides, QuickTime) 

### Contribution:

I provided the dataset Seascape for the project and helped write the Dataset section by deciding the observations used and how this project will measure difficulty. Moreover, I got to write the script for dividing up the classes to their respective departments and initiated the analysis by writing early scripts of our graphs explaining if gpa_rec and rec_instr had a positive correlation amongst each department. Finally, I was able to edit the video and powerpoint used in the final presentation of the group project.
